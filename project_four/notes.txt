# Decision Trees and Random Forest

- Decision trees is a model that makes predictions by asking a sequence
of yes/no questions about the features

Example:

Is it raining?
 ├── Yes → Bring umbrella
 └── No  → Do you see dark clouds?
           ├── Yes → Bring umbrella
           └── No  → Don’t bring umbrella

- A random forest is an ensemble (collection) of many decision trees
