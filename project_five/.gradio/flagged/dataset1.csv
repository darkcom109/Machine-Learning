"Pumping Lemma argument

The pumping lemma says: if a language is regular, then any sufficiently long string in it can be split into 
𝑥
𝑦
𝑧
xyz such that repeating 
𝑦
y keeps the string in the language.

Pick 
𝑤
=
𝑎
𝑝
𝑏
𝑝
w=a
p
b
p
, where 
𝑝
p is the pumping length.

The lemma forces 
𝑦
y to be entirely inside the block of as. So if you “pump” it, you get more as than bs.

That string won’t be in L.
