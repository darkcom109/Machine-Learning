# Machine-Learning 🎭

This repository is mainly for creative ideas in regards to machine learning and algorithms.

# Highlighted Projects
- Loading, tokenising and training a language model using Tiny Shakespeare (Project Two)
- Predicting student scores and house prices using Linear Regression Modelling (Project Three + Project Four)
- Gradio application for summarising input (Project Six)
  
This repository contains many projects on machine learning
- Project One, learn about pipelines, tokenisation, prompt batching and temperature
- Project Two, learn about loading datasets, tokenising datasets, training a model and fine-tuning
- Project Three, learn about linear and logistic regression models
- Project Four, learn about decision trees and random forests
- Project Five, learn about Gradio and other types of model configurations (e.g. summarise)
- Project Six, more custom Gradio apps and advanced models
